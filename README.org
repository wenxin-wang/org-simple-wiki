#+TITLE: Simple Wiki based on Org mode
* Introduction

A bunch of helper funcions for a personal wiki. Pages can be grouped by
directories, and tagged with keywords, which can be used for navigation and
searching. Depends on `cl-lib`, `helm-projectile` and `helm-ag`.

** Example

#+BEGIN_SRC org 
#+TITLE: Org Wiki
#+WIKI_KW: org-mode wiki

* Refs
wiki:org-mode
[[wiki:org mode]]
[[wiki:org mode][Org mode]]
#+END_SRC

** Usage
   - customize =org-simple-wiki-locaion= to be the root directory of the wiki
   - =M-x org-simple-wiki-find-file= for finding pages by names
   - =M-x org-simple-wiki-find-file-by-keyword= to view full list of keywords,
     then select one, press enter and find pages by that keyword
   - =M-x org-simple-wiki-search-ag= for finding pages by any contents
   - =M-x org-simple-wiki-search-keyword-ag= for finding pages by keywords

* Installation

Install `org-simple-wiki.el` with preferred methods. [[https://github.com/wenxin-wang/.spacemacs.d/tree/master/layers/org-simple-wiki][Here]] is an example configuration layer for [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]].
